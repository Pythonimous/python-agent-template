# UF-XXX â€” Replace With Flow Name

> Rename the file and keep the `id`/heading synchronized. Drop this tip once the flow is in use.

## Goal
- Describe why this journey exists and the user value it delivers.

## Actors
- **Primary**: TODO
- **Secondary**: Optional supporting actors (delete if none).

## Preconditions
- List environmental or system requirements that must already be true.

## Steps
1. Enumerate each user or system action in order.
2. Include alternative branches inline where it helps readability.

## Edge Cases
- Capture off-nominal scenarios worth acknowledging or testing later.

## Expected Results
- Bullet the observable outcomes that prove the flow succeeded.

## Related Tests
- Unit: TODO or `None` if not applicable.
- Integration: TODO or `None`.
- E2E: Reference pytest node IDs, e.g. `tests/e2e/test_flow.py::test_happy_path`.

## Notes (optional)
- Open questions, follow-ups, or implementation hints.
- Delete this section if it adds no signal.
