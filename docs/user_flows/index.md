# User Flow Index

Track end-to-end user journeys for this project. Each flow file uses the `UF-###` naming convention so automation can discover, diff, and test them.

> The scaffold ships without project-specific flows; downstream projects copy UF-000 and add their own entries below. Keep each file's front matter (`id`, `name`, `last_updated`, `status`) in sync with this table.

| ID | Name | Path | Summary | Status | Last Updated |
|----|------|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| *(add flows here)* |  |  |  |  |  |
| UF-000 | Template | docs/user_flows/UF-000-template.md | Copy this file to seed project-specific user flows. | draft | 2025-10-14 |

## How to use
- Start here to locate the relevant flow ID and file path.
- Load the specific flow file before implementing or updating behavior.
- Update this table whenever you add, rename, or retire a flow. Keep the rows ordered by Flow ID.
