# User Flow Index

Track end-to-end user journeys for this project. Each flow file uses the `UF-###` naming convention so automation can discover, diff, and test them.

> The scaffold ships without project-specific flows; downstream projects copy UF-000 and add their own entries below.

| Flow ID | Title | Status | Last Updated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *(add flows here)* |  |  |  |
| [UF-000](UF-000-template.md) | **Template** â€“ copy for new flows | n/a | 2025-10-14 |

> Update this table whenever you add, rename, or retire a flow. Keep the rows ordered by Flow ID.
